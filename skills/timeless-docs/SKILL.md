# Timeless Docs

Rewrite documentation and code comments so they describe what the system **is**, not how it got there. State the current design directly. Do not reference history, transitions, or absences. Focus on non-trivial information — too much information is already bad information.

Rationale: docs that describe a transition decay the moment the transition is forgotten. A reader who never knew the old state gains nothing from being told about it. State what is; history belongs in git.

This governs code comments as much as prose. The contrast patterns are easy to slip into when a comment explains why a line exists.

## The rules

1. **Describe the current state directly.** No history, no transitions, no absences.
2. **Keep only non-trivial information.** Cut anything that restates the obvious or adds no signal.
3. **Write it to be read.** Plain language, short and to the point — but not so terse it turns cryptic.

## Readability

Docs earn their place by being read. Once a passage states the present tense and carries only non-trivial facts, make it easy to take in:

- **Plain language.** Prefer the common word to the fancy one; keep sentences short and active. Spell out a term of art the first time the reader needs it; drop jargon that adds nothing.
- **Short, not cryptic.** Cut filler, hedging, and throat-clearing — not the context a reader needs to understand the line on its own. A comment no one can parse without reverse-engineering the code has been trimmed too far.
- **Concrete over abstract.** Name the actual thing (`Config/Base.xcconfig`, `/session`), not "the relevant configuration."
- **One idea per sentence.** Split a sentence that carries two.

## Forbidden patterns

Rewrite or remove any of these:

- **Temporal contrast** — "now it is X" / "currently X" when it implies a prior state
- **Change narration** — "changed from X to Y" / "migrated from X" / "no longer X" / "used to X"
- **Prior-state markers** — "previously X" / "formerly X" / "renamed from X"
- **Rejected-alternative contrast** — "rather than X" / "instead of X" / "not Y" when it contrasts with an alternative or discarded approach; state only what the code does
- **Negative inventories** — "no X, no Y, no Z here"; state what is there, not what isn't
- **Old/new labels** — "the old X" / "the new X"

## Rewrite examples

Prose:

```
❌ The config loader was migrated from YAML and now parses config.toml.
✅ The config loader parses config.toml.

❌ Previously this used a global cache; it now uses a per-request cache.
✅ Each request gets its own cache.

❌ This endpoint returns JSON rather than the old XML format.
✅ This endpoint returns JSON.

❌ The new auth flow replaces the deprecated token endpoint.
✅ Auth uses the /session endpoint.

❌ Tenant values live in Swift, not xcconfig — we moved them out of build settings.
✅ Tenant values live in Swift.

❌ No Redis, no Kafka, no external queues — everything runs in-process.
✅ Jobs run in-process via a bounded worker pool.

❌ No checked-in Info.plist. All keys are in xcconfig now.
✅ All Info.plist keys are declared as INFOPLIST_KEY_* in Config/Base.xcconfig.
```

The last pair shows the general move for a negative inventory: replace "what isn't there" with the concrete mechanism that *is* — often more specific and more useful than the line it replaces, not just shorter.

Code comments:

```
❌ // changed to 30s from 10s to avoid flaky timeouts
✅ // 30s: shorter values flake under CI load

❌ // formerly returned nil; now returns an empty array
✅ // returns an empty array when there are no matches

❌ // MainActor isolation is now the default
✅ // MainActor isolation is the default

❌ // use a set instead of a list for dedupe
✅ // set: callers rely on uniqueness

❌ // run the action in a Task rather than driving a .task off state
✅ // run the async action in a Task the button owns
```

## The one distinction that matters

Not every negation is forbidden. Separate a **genuine current property** from a **rejected-alternative contrast**.

- **Keep** a negation that states a real, current constraint the reader needs:
  - "Order is not preserved across batches."
  - "IDs are not unique across shards."
  - "This call is not thread-safe."
- **Cut the contrast** when the negation only points at a discarded approach:
  - "Uses a set instead of a list." → "Stores IDs in a set."
  - "Returns JSON, not XML." → "Returns JSON."

Test: would a reader who never knew the alternative still need this sentence? If yes, keep it (as a plain statement of fact). If it only makes sense against the old/other approach, strip the contrast.

Likewise, **keep the reason, drop the history.** "Changed to 30s because 10s was flaky" carries a real constraint (short timeouts flake) wrapped in a transition. Preserve the constraint, discard the "changed to": "30s tolerates CI load spikes."

## Where history is the content — do not strip

Some documents exist to record change. Leave these alone, or ask before touching them:

- `CHANGELOG.md`, release notes, version history
- Migration guides and upgrade guides
- Architecture Decision Records / decision logs (see the `decision-log` skill)
- Deprecation notices with a removal timeline — these warn about the current and near future, and are still load-bearing

If the user's selected area includes one of these, flag it and confirm before editing rather than flattening its history away.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine the scope

- If the user named a file or directory, use it.
- If they said "this project" or gave no target, infer from context (the file open, the recent diff, or the repo's docs). For a whole project, enumerate candidates (`README`, `docs/`, module/header comments, docstrings) and, if the set is large, propose a short plan before mass-editing.
- If the target is genuinely ambiguous, ask which files or directory to work on.

### 2. Screen for carve-outs

Identify any files where history is the point (see the section above). Set them aside and confirm with the user before editing them.

### 3. Scan for the forbidden patterns

Read each target and collect candidate edits. Search hints for the mechanical cases:

```
grep -rniE "no longer|used to|previously|formerly|renamed from|migrated from|instead of|rather than|the old |the new |now (uses|returns|is|it)" <path>
```

Grep only surfaces obvious cases — the temporal-contrast and negative-inventory patterns often need a human read. Do not rely on grep alone.

### 4. Rewrite to present state

For each candidate:

- Restate the current behavior directly, preserving every non-trivial fact — constraints, contracts, invariants, gotchas, and the genuine *why* behind a choice.
- If a sentence's only content is the transition and there is no current-state fact to keep, delete it.
- Match the surrounding voice, tense, and formatting. Make minimal edits — do not rewrite passages that are already timeless and clear.

### 5. Concision and readability pass

Remove statements that restate what the code plainly does, ceremonial comments, and redundant sentences. Keep the signal: anything a competent reader could not infer at a glance. Then apply the Readability rules — plain words, short active sentences, concrete nouns, one idea per sentence — without trimming so far that the line becomes cryptic.

### 6. Verify

- No non-trivial information was lost.
- Every claim still matches the code.
- The prose reads naturally and stands on its own without knowledge of any prior state.
- No forbidden pattern remains.

## Guardrails

- Preserve meaning first. Never drop a genuine constraint, reason, or warning just because it is phrased as a negation or a comparison — rephrase it as a plain present-state statement.
- Do not invent current-state facts you cannot verify from the code. If a doc's claim looks stale, flag it instead of guessing.
- When unsure whether a line is a genuine property or a rejected-alternative contrast, keep it and note it for the user rather than deleting.
- Keep edits tight and reviewable; do not reflow or restructure whole files under the banner of prose cleanup.

## Output

Report what changed, grouped by file:

- file and location
- pattern (temporal contrast, change narration, negative inventory, trivial detail, …)
- before → after, or the deleted text and why it carried no current-state signal

If any carve-out files or ambiguous negations were found, list them separately as items needing the user's decision.
